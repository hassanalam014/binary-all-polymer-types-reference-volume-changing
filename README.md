# Binary-All-Polymer-Types-Reference-Volume-Changing

## Project Overview
The "Binary All Polymer Types Reference Volume Changing" repository is a collection of detailed scripts and data for analyzing the reference volume changes of binary polymer types. The project facilitates the modeling and visualization of various polymer properties, spanning experimental data to theoretical analyses.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides Python scripts for data manipulation, visualization, and computation of polymer-related parameters.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Includes scripts for plotting 3D graphs and parametric comparisons.
- **Data Handling**: Robust data splitting and processing routines for experimental datasets.
- **Customization and Flexibility**: Modular scripts for calculating specific properties and adapting to various scenarios.

## Usage
- Use the `loadExperimentalData.py` script to load experimental datasets.
- Run the analysis scripts, such as `Parameters_for_Mixtures_and_Tg.py`, to generate polymer-specific parameters.
- Utilize visualization scripts like `plot_Tg_nsolve_POST_THESIS.py` for advanced graph plotting.
- Modify the variables in each script to tailor the analysis to your datasets or objectives.

## Configuration
Each Python script provides inline comments to guide configuration adjustments. You may need to:
- Edit file paths for data imports.
- Update parameters specific to polymer analysis.
- Adjust plotting style and format.
